\section{ZDC calibration procedure}

When a neutron emitted from a nucleus hits the three towers of the ZDC, the ratio of energy loss
in the three towers should be 
around 6:3:1, and the ADC readout value is proportional to the energy loss and the voltage on the
photomultiplier tubes (PMT)\@. Therefore, we need to check the ADC value 
distribution of each tower and calculate the ratio between them. Equally, we expect the ZDC 
single-neutron peak (SNP) to
be at the same ADC value in both, East and West side, when we look at the sum.

Usually, the calibration is done iteratively. We have to take a dedicated ZDC run with
$\sim$10$\,$M events (at full luminosity, this should take around $5\,$min). Then, we
look at the resulting SNP via the procedure described in Chapter~\ref{code}.
For an illustration of the SNP see Figure~\ref{SNPillustration} and the gain of the single
towers can be seen in Figure~\ref{gain}.
The SNP should be at a safe ADC value so that the whole width of the SNP is in the ZDC measured
range. Also, the ratio between the gain of the ZDC towers should be corrected. If the
SNP is not in a safe position and/or the ratio between the towers' gain is wrong,
the voltage in the photomultiplier tubes has to be adjusted and then the whole procedure
has to be repeated.

The gain on the PMTs follows a power law
\begin{equation}
G = aU^b
\end{equation}
where $G$ is a gain and $U$ stands for voltage. The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are 
extracted from \cite{ZDCvoltsDependence}
and are equal to approximately
\begin{equation}
b=4.2\,, \qquad a=4.0\,.
\end{equation}

We usually use the desired position of the single neutron peak as 60 ADC values. To calculate
the desired voltages we use the formula
\begin{equation}
U_{\text{result}} = U_\text{current}\left(\frac{G_\text{desired}}{G} 
\frac{R_\text{desired}}{R}\right)^{1/4.2}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the current position of the neutron peak, $G_\text{desired}$ is the desired position
of the neutron peak (currently 60), $R_\text{desired}$ is the desired ratio between the gain of the ADC SUM
tower and the current tower, and $R$ is the current ratio.

For the run 2016, the desired ADC values of the SNP were set as 60 and the desired ratio between the
towers was the usual 6:3:1. As described in the previous section, the SNP was analyzed
and the resulting voltages were written in~Table~\ref{uncorected}. The position of the single
neutron peaks in this test
are shown in Figures~\ref{eastPlot} and \ref{westPlot}.
The ratios between the towers with the resulting voltages from the test
are shown in Table~\ref{corected}.
Subsequently, new high-voltage values are also calculated.

Channels where the voltage would exceed 3000 V in Table~\ref{corected} were set to 3000 V to
protect the PMTs. New single neutron peak as well as the double neutron peak were found and
plotted in Figures~\ref{eastThird}
and \ref{westThird}. The position of the double neutron peak was set as twice the mean
of the single neutron peak.
The resulting voltages in the next iteration are in Table~\ref{thirdCalib}.

The results of the test with voltages from~Table~\ref{thirdCalib} are shown in
Figures~\ref{oneMoreTestEast} and \ref{oneMoreTestWest}\@. The single neutron and double
neutron peaks were fitted. The ratios between the towers in the East were measured as
60.29:29.41:10.30 and in the West 61.07:30.52:8.41. 

In conclusion, the ratios between the towers were closer to the desired ones in the
test with voltages from Table~\ref{thirdCalib}. The ratios between the single and double
neutron peak in the East towers were closer to the real values in the test
from~Table~\ref{corected}. Therefore, we suggest that the result voltages from~Table~\ref{corected}
are used for the East towers and the voltages from Table~\ref{thirdCalib} are used for the
West towers. This setup was tested and the neutron peaks are plotted in Figures~\ref{finalTestEast}
and~\ref{finalTestWest}. The ratios between the towers were calculated as
61.30:28.58:10.17 for the East towers and 61.02:30.53:8.45 for the West towers.
Which is close enough to the desired values.

Later, the ZDC gain should be monitored also. For run 16, see the monitoring page \cite{ZDCmonPage}.
